TODO:

- Wireup DSL
- Attempt "diamond" consumer pattern (with tests)
- Rewrite code test first
- Benchmark code (go test -bench=.) (with GOMAXPROCS=2 if env GOMAXPROCS=1)
- MultiProducerSequencer (and appropriate hooks to barrier)
- Squeeze little bits of performance here and there by trying a few different things
	e.g. pointers vs structs, padding, etc.

- contributors
- license
- readme (Github markdown?)

- Website with cool images and documentation? (e.g. GoConvey)
